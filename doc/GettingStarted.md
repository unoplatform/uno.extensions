# How-To: Creating an application with Uno.Extensions

This tutorial will walk through how to create an Uno application with the `dotnet new` tool, which is already configured to use the Uno.Extensions.

## Step-by-steps

### 1. Installing extension templates

The `dotnet` templates included in the `Uno.Templates` package are used to easily create new projects that already reference the Uno.Extensions.

* Open a command prompt and run the following

    `dotnet new install Uno.Templates`

* Navigate to the desired projects directory, and use the `unoapp` template to generate the starter solution discussed above

    `dotnet new unoapp -o MyProjectName`

    The argument specified after the `-o` flag (i.e. MyProjectName) will act as the name for both a containing directory and the generated solution.

* Open the solution in Visual Studio

    `.\MyProjectName\MyProjectName.sln`

### 2. Exploring the Solution

The generated solution will contain:

* *MyProjectName* - for application logic, and other constructs like view models and services, as well as the pages, controls and other views that make up the UI of the application
* *MyProjectName.DataContracts* - for entities that are shared with an API backend.
* *MyProjectName.Server* - ASP.NET project that hosts a WebAPI and can be used to host the WASM application.
* *Platforms/MyProjectName.** - platform-specific projects for each supported platform.
* *MyProjectName.Tests* and *MyProjectName.UI.Tests* - for writing unit and UI tests respectively.

### 3. Running the Application

* Select a target from the drop-down as pictured below

* Click the “play” button, or press F5 to start debugging. The necessary projects in the solution will be compiled and deployed based on the target platform.

### 4. Running the Unit Tests

* Right click the project inside Tests\\MyProjectName.Tests to open the context menu

* Select *Run Tests*

    The application will be compiled and the test cases will run.

> [!TIP]
> If the 'Run Tests' menu item doesn't exist, you need to Rebuild the solution to get Visual Studio to detect the available tests.

### 5. Running the UI tests

* Right click the MyProjectName.Wasm project to open the context menu

* Select *Set as startup project*

* Press Ctrl + F5 to start the WASM project without debugging.

* Once the application is compiled, it will launch inside your default browser. Take note of the URL which should look something like this: https://localhost:5000/Main

* Find the project *Tests\\MyProjectName.UI.Tests* and locate the *Constants.cs* file

* Open *Constants.cs* and update the WebAssemblyDefaultUri constant

    It should appear similar to this:

    ```cs
    public readonly static string WebAssemblyDefaultUri = "https://localhost:5000/";
    ```

* Go back to the project *Tests\\MyProjectName.UI.Tests* and right click. Then, *Run Tests*
