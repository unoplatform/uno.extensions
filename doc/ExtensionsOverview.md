# Get to a fully functional project in minutes

Uno.Extensions is a series of NuGet packages designed to encapsulate common functions when building multi-platform mobile, desktop, and web applications using Uno Platform. Thoughtfully designed components and features retain easy extensibility and customization while providing a solid foundation for your application.

The Uno.Extensions follows the Microsoft.Extensions model that creates a host environment where you can register additional dependencies. The registered dependencies are then available throughout the application via the Services (`IServiceProvider`) property on the `IHost` instance.
