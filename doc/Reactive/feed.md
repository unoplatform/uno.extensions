#Feed

## Sources: How to create a feed
You can build a _feed_ from different sources. The main entry point is the static class `Feed`:

Given an `IWeatherService` and `ILocationService`:
```csharp
public interface IWeatherService
{
	/// <summary>
	/// Asynchronously gets the current weather
	/// </summary>
	Task<WeatherInfo> GetCurrentWeather(CancellationToken ct);

	/// <summary>
	/// Asynchronously gets the details of a weather alert.
	/// </summary>
	Task<string> GetAlertDetails(WeatherAlert alert, CancellationToken ct);

	/// <summary>
	/// Asynchronously gets the weather forecast for the given day
	/// </summary>
	Task<WeatherInfo> GetWeatherForecast(DateTime date, CancellationToken ct);
}

public record WeatherInfo(double Temperature, WeatherAlert? Alert);

public record WeatherAlert(Guid Id, string? Title);

public interface ILocationService
{
	/// <summary>
	/// Asynchronously gets the name of the current city.
	/// </summary>
	Task<string> GetCurrentCity(CancellationToken ct);

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets teh list of all supported cities.
	/// </summary>
	Task<ImmutableList<string>> GetCities(CancellationToken ct);
}
```

### Async
Creates a feed from an async method.

```csharp
private IWeatherService _weatherService;

public IFeed<WeatherInfo> Weather => Feed.Async(async ct => await _weatherService.GetCurrentWeather(ct));
```

The loaded data can be refreshed using a `Signal` trigger that will re-invoke the async method.

> [!NOTE]
> A `Signal` represents a trigger that can be raised at anytime, for instance within an `ICommand` data-bound to a "pull-to-refresh".

```csharp
private IWeatherService _weatherService;
private Signal _refreshWeather = new();

public IFeed<WeatherInfo> Weather => Feed.Async(async ct => await _weatherService.GetCurrentWeather(ct), _refreshWeather);

public void RefreshWeather()
	=> _refreshWeather.Raise();
```


### AsyncEnumerable
This adapts an `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` into a _feed_.

```csharp
private IWeatherService _weatherService;

public IFeed<WeatherInfo> Weather => Feed.AsyncEnumerable(() => GetWeather());

private async IAsyncEnumerable<WeatherInfo> GetWeather([EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken ct = default)
{
	while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
	{
		yield return await _weatherService.GetCurrentWeather(ct);
		await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromHours(1), ct);
	}
}
```
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to use a `CancellationToken` marked with the [`[EnumeratorCancellation]` attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.compilerservices.enumeratorcancellationattribute).
> This token will be flagged as cancelled when the last subscription of the feed is being removed.
> Typically this will be when the `ViewModel` is being disposed.

### Create
This gives you the ability to create a specialized _feed_ by dealing directly with _messages_.

> [!NOTE]
> This is designed for advanced usage and should probably not be used directly in apps.

```csharp
public IFeed<WeatherInfo> Weather => Feed.Create(GetWeather);

private async IAsyncEnumerable<Message<WeatherInfo>> GetWeather([EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken ct = default)
{
	var message = Message<WeatherInfo>.Initial;
	var weather = Option<WeatherInfo>.Undefined();
	var error = default(Exception);
	while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
	{
		try
		{
			weather = await _weatherService.GetCurrentWeather(ct);
			error = default;
		}
		catch (Exception ex)
		{
			error = ex;
		}

		yield return message = message.With().Data(weather).Error(error);
		await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromHours(1), ct);
	}
}
```

## Operators: How to interact with a feed
You can apply some operators directly on any _feed_.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the linq syntax with feeds:
> ```csharp
> private IFeed<int> _values;
> 
> public IFeed<string> Value => from value in _values
> 	where value == 42
> 	select value.ToString();
> ```

### Where
Applies a predicate on the _data_.

Be aware that unlike `IEnumerable`, `IObservable`, and `IAsyncEnumerable`, if the predicate returns false, a message with a `None` _data_ will be published.

```csharp
public IFeed<WeatherAlert> Alert => Weather
	.Where(weather => weather.Alert is not null)
	.Select(weather => weather.Alert!);
```

### Select
Synchronously projects each data from the source _feed_.

```csharp
public IFeed<WeatherAlert> Alert => Weather
	.Where(weather => weather.Alert is not null)
	.Select(weather => weather.Alert!);
```

### SelectAsync
Asynchronously projects each data from the source _feed_.

```csharp
public IFeed<string> AlertDetails => Alert
	.SelectAsync(async (alert, ct) => await _weatherService.GetAlertDetails(alert, ct));
```

### GetAwaiter
This allows the use of `await` on a _feed_, for instance when you want to capture the current value to use it in a command.
```csharp
public async ValueTask ShareAlert(CancellationToken ct)
{
	var alert = await Alert; // Gets the current WeatherAlert
	await _shareService.Share(alert, ct);
}
```
