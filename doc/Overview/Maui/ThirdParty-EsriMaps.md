# .NET MAUI Embedding - EsriMaps

## Installation

In order to use the YYYY controls, you first need to [instructions and link].

## Sample App

An existing sample app that showcases the controls is available [here](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Samples/tree/master/UI/MauiEmbedding/ArcGisApp)

## Getting Started

1. Create a new application using the `unoapp` template, enabling .NET MAUI Embedding. In this case we're going to use the Blank template (`-preset blank`) and include .NET MAUI Embedding support (`-maui`).

    dotnet new unoapp -preset blank -maui -o MauiEmbeddingApp
    ```
